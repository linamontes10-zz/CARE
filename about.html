    <p class="information"> Girls Who Code is a program that gives young women in high school and middle school an opportunity to delve into the world of technology and computer science. GWC has clubs that take place during the school year. They also host <q>Summer Immersion Programs<q>. These programs are aimed towards rising juniors and seniors. The program lasts for 7 weeks, with 2 weeks being dedicated towards a final project. As part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Adobe NYC, we created this awareness website by the name of C.A.R.E. </p>
    <br> <br>
    <p>
    <h6 class="subtitles"> C.A.R.E. </h6>
    <p class="information"> There are four founders of C.A.R.E. We chose an awareness website in order to speak up about topics each of us is passionate about. There are 4 members working on this project, allowing us to have diverse awareness topics based on each person's desires. We speak up for everyone. We do this because we are the Coders Advocating for the Rights of Everyone. </p>

    <p class="information"> I am a rising Senior at Bard High School Early College in Lower East Side. I was born in Lebanon, but I’m of Armenian descent and currently live in Queens. After participating in Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, I thoroughly enjoy web design and web development. I aspire to major in Computer Science in college and possibly philosophy as a minor. I love mediterranean food, russian literatures, makeup and techonology. I hope that one day, in the near future, I will own a turtle. </p>

    <h6 class="subtitles"> Faith Duggan </h6>
    <p class="information"> As of 2017, I am 16 year-old student at The Nightingale-Bamford School. I have participated in the New York Times summer Academy and Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program. I am interested in computer science, sports, peace and quiet, and traveling. I don’t often get traveling and peace and quiet at the same time though. My loud Irish and Dominican family make sure that never happens.</p>

    <h6 class="subtitles"> Lina Montes </h6>
    <p class="information"> I am a rising Senior at Yonkers Middle High School. After participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, I have developed a love for Computer Science. I am a Colombian woman, a daughter of immigrant parents, an athlete, a dog owner, and a coder. Being raised by Colombian immigrants has shaped me into a compassionate and empathetic human being. I have many varied interests, some from the American culture, and others from the Colombian culture. Growing up so close to NYC has taught me much about being respectful of different cultures. However, growing up in Westchester has exposed me to the ignorance of others that is present outside of a diverse city. I can not be who I am without being all of those things.</p>

    <h6 class="subtitles"> Savannah Yusko </h6>
    <p class="information"> I am currently sixteen years old and I am a rising junior at New Dorp High School in Staten Island, New York. I joined the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program because I am passionate about learning more about coding and would like to make a difference in the world through web development.  I also love dogs, hanging out with friends, and exploring new cities.</p>
