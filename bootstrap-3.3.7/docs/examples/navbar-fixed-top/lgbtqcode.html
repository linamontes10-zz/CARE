    <h6 class="subtitles"> Description: </h6>
    <p class="information"> LGBTQ+ is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. The plus (sign) emphasizes the spectrum of genders and sexualities involve in the community. LGBTQ+ awareness advocates for the equalization and the acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals in our society. Back in June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the denial of same-sex marriage and the refusal to recognize those marriages was unconstitutional. The LGBTQ+ community achieved one of their greatest victories and it seemed like society was moving forward to acceptance and equality for all. However, the Trump Administration poses a threat to our progress. His cabinet and undersecretaries, such as Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, are some of the most anti-LGBTQ+ who accused the Obama administration of manipulation. Recently, Donald Trump banned LGBTQ+ individuals from serving their country because they are a “burden”. This is ironic because Trump himself never properly served the military. He is simply trying to make LGBTQ+ community invisible. Donald Trump is a president who simply doesn’t care.
As a society, we must ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals receive the same respect, protection and rights as everyone else. We must educate ourselves with the struggles that LGBTQ+ communities face and support them throughout the Trump Administration and beyond. C.A.R.E. will provide credible sources, bring awareness to issues that the LGBTQ+ communities face along with ways to assist and help.
