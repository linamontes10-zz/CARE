    <h6 class="subtitles"> Description: </h6>
    <p class="information"> Equity. Equality. Women. Sports.These four words don’t mix well together, but they need to. Women and men’s sports teams and associations have never been equal nor equitable. Since many people use the two words interchangeably, they seem to have the same definition.  Equality is when everything is identical, no matter the differences or the situations. Equity means giving everyone what he or she needs to become successful. This change should not stop the evolution towards equity and equality of women’s basketball, it should also help it to become better for women and should create a better game to watch. <br>
    Women have earned the right of equality with men in many other arenas besides sports, while men just believe they deserve it. Women deserve equity in terms of accommodations based on physical differences, as well as equality in terms of equal pay, sponsorship, higher status and prestige, and the commercial benefits of the sport they play.
