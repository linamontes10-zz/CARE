    <h6 class="subtitles"> Description: </h6>
    <p class="information"> Reproductive Health has become a popular topic surrounding human rights in the past couple of years. With the possible loss of Planned Parenthood and the banishment of abortion in the future, women nationwide feel that their reproductive rights have been violated. In addition, if we lose funding to Planned Parenthood, numerous amounts of women will be neglected access to birth control, feminine hygiene products, and sexual education. Women should not have their own personal choices on their bodies to be decided on by conservative cis-white men who have no experience of "walking in a woman's shoes" whatsoever. <br> <br> The links and events provided below bring forth the option to voice your opinion on reproductive health in a positive way. The contact information is given in the website's link below. CARE hopes that you will help reproductive health rights and issues gain more attention and help women gain access to Planned Parenthood's vital necessities for them nationwide through our helpful services. </p>
